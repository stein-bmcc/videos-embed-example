### Different Aspect Ratios

In order to make the embedded video responsive, there is some special CSS that is applied to a div around the iframe. This CSS is different for different aspect ratio videos. Most video is 16:9 aspect ratio and if yours is, you won't have to change anything. If you have a 4:3 video or other ratio then you will have to update the class in the video wrapper. Here are two examples

 #### 16:9 Aspect Ratio
 This is what is already there.
```
<div class="videoWrapper ratio-16-9">

	<!-- iframe below is Copy & Pasted from YouTube replace with your own -->
	<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiJzbXzOdHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
</div><!-- end .videoWrapper -->
```

 #### 4:3 Aspect Ratio
 For this change the ratio in the class to **ratio-4-3**
```
<div class="videoWrapper ratio-4-3">

	<!-- iframe below is Copy & Pasted from YouTube replace with your own -->
	<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tocJ_mKu1GU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
</div><!-- end .videoWrapper -->
```
